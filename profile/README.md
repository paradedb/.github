Hi there! Welcome to ParadeDB. [ParadeDB](https://paradedb.com) is an Elasticsearch alternative built on Postgres. We're modernizing the features of Elasticsearch's product suite, starting with real-time search and analytics. We are part of the Postgres-centric data stack movement and are building enterprise-grade search (full-text, vector, and hybrid) and analytics (local and over data lakes) for Postgres users.
