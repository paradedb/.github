You want better search, not the burden of Elasticsearch.

[ParadeDB](https://paradedb.com) is the modern Elasticsearch alternative built as a **Postgres extension**. It brings full-text, hybrid, and faceted search directly into PostgreSQL — no separate search system required.

Because ParadeDB is just Postgres, it can run as a logical replica of any managed Postgres instance or be installed within any self-hosted Postgres cluster. No new infrastructure, no sync pipelines, no eventual consistency.

## Getting Started

## Who's Using ParadeDB?

Companies use ParadeDB to replace Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, and custom search stacks while keeping Postgres as their system of record. Explore [customer stories](https://paradedb.com/customers) to learn more.
