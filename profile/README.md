You want better search, not the burden of Elasticsearch. [ParadeDB](https://paradedb.com) is the modern Elastic alternative built as a Postgres extension. ParadeDB brings everything you need from a modern search engine into Postgres, including text, hybrid, and faceted search. Because it is just Postgres, it can run as a logical replica of any managed Postgres or be installed inside any self-hosted Postgres.
